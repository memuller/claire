    # nodes :: An array of [host, port] pairs. See Connection#new, which offers
    #          a more flexible way of defining nodes.

    # options :: A hash of options.
    #
    # Options:
    #
    # :strict :: If true, collections must exist to be accessed and must
    #            not exist to be created. See #collection and #create_collection.
    #
    # :pk :: A primary key factory object that must respond to :create_pk,
    #        which should take a hash and return a hash which merges the
    #        original hash with any primary key fields the factory wishes
    #        to inject. (NOTE: if the object already has a primary key,
    #        the factory should not inject a new key; this means that the
    #        object is being used in a repsert but it already exists.) The
    #        idea here is that when ever a record is inserted, the :pk
    #        object's +create_pk+ method will be called and the new hash
    #        returned will be inserted.
    #
    # :slave_ok :: Only used if +nodes+ contains only one host/port. If
    #              false, when connecting to that host/port we check to
    #              see if the server is the master. If it is not, an error
    #              is thrown.
    #
    # :logger :: Optional Logger instance to which driver usage information
    #            will be logged.
    #
    # :auto_reconnect :: DEPRECATED. See http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replica+Pairs+in+Ruby
